# Module Eight Journal

**Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.**

***What did you do particularly well?***

I was able to recover from roadblock pretty fast. There was a missing Python function issue and I was able to solve it by using debugging and Project Solution menu. I placed Pythonfile in wrong folder hence any functions I added wasn't being connected to C++ section.

***Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?***

I could enhance it in Visual Studio. It helped me  make the code cleaner and easier to understand for other developers and improve security by removing global variables and using functions more. Debugging by Visual Studio helped me pin down errors and issues when I was stuck.

***Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?***

Most challenging part was reading from file in a format that was usable in purposes I needed and also writing to a file in specific format. I was able to overcome this by using loops and comparison operators. I have used lots of functions with different parameters and return types and called them from each other to improve processing time.

***What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?***

Skills to create and use functions for variety of purposes and industry standard practices for coding, naming functions, variables and operations. Also when setting up the C++ and Python I learned that settings PATH option was easier than I thought. All I had to do was update Include and Library paths by adding Python's INCLUDE and LIBS folders to project configuration settings.

***How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?***

I used functions, in-line comments and standard naming practices on functions and variables. Formatting by Visual studio helped make it easier to read and understand. Not having a lot of code in one place and instead using different functions to do variety of operations made it easier to adopt to different program.
